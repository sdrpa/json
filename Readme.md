# JSON

JSON parsing library based on https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss (3df829260598af748d828654a2da598e459156a8). Extracted in order to keep other modules independent of JSON implementation. In future, [SE-0166 Swift Archival & Serialization](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md) should probably be used.
